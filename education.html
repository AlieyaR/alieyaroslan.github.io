<p>This is my high school named Sekolah Menengah Kebangsaan Temenggong. I went to school<br>
from 2013 to 2017. The school located 5km from my house. When I was in lower secondary which is<br>
in form 1 till form 3, I was accepted in the first class at the school which is in class KAA (Kelas Aliran Agama).<br>
My class is different from other classes because I have to take extra subject which is Arabic Language and<br>
Quran lesson.<br>
For upper secondary, I got accepted in second class. This is because, I dind't do well in PT3.<br>
I have to split up with my friends from lower secondary because all of them got accepted in first class<br>
which is Science Strem class. However, my new classmates were friendly and I got used to them in a very short time.<br>
I have to take three electives subject which is Sport Science, Account and Business.</p>
